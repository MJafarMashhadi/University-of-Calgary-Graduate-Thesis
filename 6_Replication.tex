\chapter{Replication and Extension}

\section{Introduction}


In the second case study in addition to confirming that the technique is applicable on other software, I could improve on some aspects as well.
I could replicate the relative differences in performance of different CPD methods. The same goes with classic machine learning classifiers.
Also, I confirmed that a similar neural network architecture can be trained to infer an state model of Paparazzi as well.

In addition to replicating these, I created a hyper-parameter tuning pipeline to get a better performance out of the neural network model. I used a simple grid search technique over the hyper-parameters, in two steps to find the sweet spot for the best overall performance as measured by 8 metrics.
