hyphenated words or words separated by a slash are counted as two

\chapter{Acknowledgments}

The acknowledgments are a place for you to thank/recognize academics
or organizations that supported you (remember you cannot make changes
once your thesis is submitted, so be thoughtful!)  You should include
this when you want to acknowledge people who may or may not be
formally recognized in your thesis elsewhere.  People usually
mentioned in the acknowledgments include your supervisor and
committee, grant support, helpful fellow students, lab mates, or
family members.

Since we're using \LaTeX{} and the \verb|memoir| package, we should
thank Don Knuth, Leslie Lamport, and Peter Wilson.\footnote{These are
the authors of \citet{Knuth1986,Lamport1986,Wilson2016}.}
