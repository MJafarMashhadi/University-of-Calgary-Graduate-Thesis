Inferring behavior model of a running software system is quite useful for several automated software engineering tasks, such as program comprehension, anomaly detection, and testing. Most existing dynamic model inference techniques are white-box, i.e., they require source code to be instrumented to get run-time traces. However, in many systems, instrumenting the entire source code is not possible (e.g., when using black-box third-party libraries) or might be very costly. %One useful scenario for automated black-box behavior inference is in software control units (such as autopilots), where the software system's reactions over time changes based on the inputs. Run-time state models of such systems are very powerful means for anomaly detection and debugging. 
Unfortunately, most black-box techniques that detect states over time are either univariate, or make assumptions on the data distribution, or have limited power for learning over a long period of past behavior. 
To overcome the above issues, in this thesis, I proposed a hybrid deep neural network that accepts as input a set of time series, one per input/output signal of the system, and applies a set of convolutional and recurrent layers to learn the non-linear correlations between signals and the patterns, over time. 
I have applied this approach on two real UAV autopilot case studies: one from our industry partner, MicroPilot (MP in short), with half a million lines of C code and one widely used open source solution: Paparazzi. 
I ran more than 1200 system-level tests in total and inferred states, over time.
In case of Paparazzi, as it did not include system tests like MP, I created a tool that generates and executes meaningful test scenarios.
Comparison with several traditional time series change point detection techniques showed that this approach improves their performance by up to 102\% in MPs case and 49\% in Paparazzi's, in terms of finding state change points, measured by F1 score. I also showed that this state classification algorithm provides on average 90.45\% F1 score for MP and 81.92\% for Paparazzi, which improves traditional classification algorithms by up to 17\% in MP's case and 68\% in Paparazzi's.

%Furthermore, I verified efficacy of this approach with a second case study: Paparazzi open source autopilot. As it did not include system tests like MP, I created a tool that generates and runs fuzzy test scenarios. Using the tool I generated and executed 378 test cases %325 test cases using different permutations of a flight plan; I used the fuzzy test execution tool to run 378 simulations using those scenarios; some scenarios were used twice but due to fuzzing in other parameters the generated data are different. I used the data that was produced during those executions for replication. 
%The improvements of this approach over the baselines, as measured by F1 score, were up to 49\% in change point detection and up to 68\% for state detection.
In addition, by creating a hyper-parameter tuning pipeline using grid search technique, despite having a way smaller training set compared to MicroPilot's (7 times smaller), in the second case study I managed to get a better performance, up to 42\% better, out of the neural network model as measured by 8 metrics.
The tuning performance is compared to using the same hyper-parameters that worked for MP's case, for Paparazzi.%  As a result, in addition to confirming that the technique is applicable on other software, I.
