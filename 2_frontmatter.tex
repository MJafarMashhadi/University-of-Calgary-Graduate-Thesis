\chapter{Preface}

This thesis is an original work by the author. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item The first chapter frames the problem being tackled. 
    \item The second chapter explains the data collection process that is step 0 in performing any analysis on the software. This chapter gets more technical and points to my open source contributions and the testing tool set I developed.% for data collection purpose. 
    The details are moved to an appendix.
    \item Chapter~3 Contains the manuscript I published in ASE '20 conference. In that paper, I introduce a deep neural network for the task and compare it to several baselines. The case study in this paper is the auto-pilot developed by our industry partner.
    \item The next chapter is a continuation of chapter~3. I replicated the same study on another auto pilot software, an open source one. In addition to that, I used a hyper-parameter tuning technique to improve the results even more.
    \item The last chapter wraps up the results and introduces some lines for future work.
\end{itemize}
