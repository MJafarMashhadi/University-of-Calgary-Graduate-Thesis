In this thesis, we introduced a hybrid CNN-RNN model that can be used for both CPD and state classification problems in multivariate time series. The proposed approach can be used as a black-box state model inference for variety of use cases such as testing, debugging, and anomaly detection in control software systems, where there are several input signals that control output states. We have evaluated our approach on a case study of a UAV auto-pilot software from our industry partner with 888 test cases and showed significant improvement in both change point detection and state classification. In the future, we are planning to extend this research with more case studies from open source auto-pilots. In addition, better tuning of hyper-parameters will be explored. Finally, we plan to examine the use of transfer learning to reduce the labeling overhead.
